  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      csvfab opens its window in a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Chromium, Brave or Edge).
      If none is installed:  brew install --cask google-chrome

      This is the command line only. For an application in /Applications that the Finder
      can open CSV files with (and make the default):  brew install --cask fabiochelly/csvfab/csvfab
